          Fishing is an exciting and additive activity. You always want to catch more fish. You don't need to be a professional; what you need is just a set of basic gears, a few tricks, and patience. Usually you will learn how to fish in the first few minutes of trying. So don't worry even if you are a novice.

          Each day, there are times that fish eat and don't eat. When they don't eat, they will just ignore your baits. The times depend on the tide cycle. When the tide reaches the highest or lowest level, they don't eat. They eat when the rate of change of tide level is maximized. This is because when the tide level change rate is large, a lot of micro-organism floats from the bottom of the sea. They become the food of small fish, which in turn become the food of big fish. Almost everything in the sea becomes active during this period. This is the best time to fish.

          The kinds of fish you will find vary depending on the season. In summer, you will always find groups of baby snappers and some small mottled spinefoot.

          They are very active in summer. They taste sweet, and we can make exceptional tasty congee with them.

          Their fins can emit slight toxic substance. Avoid touching their fins or you may risk getting punctured, which is painful and you will feel paralyzed, immediately, for 30 minutes. But no worries, you won't die because of this ;-)

          Groupers are one of the most tasty fish and at the same time, one of the most difficult fish to catch. Usually they appear individually, swim close to the bottom of the sea, sometimes doing nothing and just sit, waiting for the best chance to catch her food. You will only find them if you are lucky or highly skilled.

          We don't classify fishing tools as novice or professional. We choose the right tools according to the environment. Basically we divide fishing tools into 2 types, those with poles and those without. Both types are equally capable of catching any kind of fish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people has a misconception that you need a fishing pole to catch big fish. In fact, the size of fish you can catch depends on the strength of the fishing wire, the size of the hook, and of course, the taste of the bait and your skill. The stronger the wire, the bigger fish you can catch before it breaks. The larger the hook, the larger bait you can use to attract bigger fish. However, a strong wire and large hook are thick and are more noticeable by fish, so it demands more fishing skills.

          Different kind of fish prefers different food. Most kinds of fish in Hong Kong like shrimps. Some like worms and don't even eat any shrimp at all. Choose your baits wisely based on the kind of fish you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Antarctic shrimp
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These are small but have a very strong smell that can attract fish from far away. They live near the South Pole and grow in a huge amount. People use them as food for farmed animals and fishing baits.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't use shrimps available in local markets because they are usually too big that small fish won't eat it. If we cut the shrimp, it will easily dissolve under water.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also don't use living shrimps because they are much more expensive, and it requires highly skilled techniques to hook it, or it will die immediately.

            Worms

        </p>
        <p>
          Worms are smelly and they can still move under water for a long time even after we cut them into pieces. We don't use worms because they are more expensive than shrimps, much more uglier, and most importantly, they carry many bacterias that can be fatal to human.

            Home made baits
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Some professionals prefer home made baits which are made of cooked meat balls with added artificial favors. They are much cheaper other types of baits, but requires more skills when fishing because the bait looks unnatural to fish.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Fake baits
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The cheapest bait is fake plastic baits which can be reused as many times as you want. It is only for the most skillful professionals who can let their baits move like a living fish under water. Usually it is used to catch squids and other big fish.
